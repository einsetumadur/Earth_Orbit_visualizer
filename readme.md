# Earth Orbit Visualizer

This is just a toy project to better understand Orbital parameters with real data.

This project is based on Processing 4 (java), to run or compile the project, you need Processing ! https://processing.org/

All TLE's are loaded from celestrak.org

You can change the TLE source in the setup function.
maxsat is the maximum number of satellites loaded. by tweaking a bit you can show multiple satellites at the same time, at the cost of performance.

Have fun tinkering !
